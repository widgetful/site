Bubble.js is a JavaScript library to help you quickly build user-triggerable popups. This is useful for things like:

<ul class="list-disc pl-4 mb-4">
  <li>Chat windows</li>
  <li>Documentation and help widgets</li>
  <li>Contact us forms</li>
  <li>Announcement modals</li>
</ul>

You will typically see these user triggerable widgets on many websites, which will use this UX pattern to assist, guide, or interact with the website visitor.

While you can build the foundation of such functionality, Bubble.js can help speed up your development time by giving your codebase a strong and consistent foundation to build your feature.
